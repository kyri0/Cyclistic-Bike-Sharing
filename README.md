# Cyclistic-Bike-Sharing
A Case Study done as a requirement for the Google Data Analytics Certificate. As part of this Capstone Project, I had to share it online.

In this case study, I used real data from a Bike Sharing Service from Chicago, though the name Cyclistic is fictional. I evaluated how different types of users engage with the service, determined trends and theorized what was causing them. I was then able to develop an action plan based on those findings.

The easiest way to visualize this project is by downloading the Cyclistic.html and opening it on your browser.

If by any chance you actually want to run this code, you might have to adjust file paths, and/or put your data on a different directory.

Requirements:

* R and R Studio
* You also might need to install some additional libraries, they are noted on the R Markdown file.
* Download the .csv files
* Download the Cyclistic.Rmd
